## `r i`. `r names(resAnchor)` {#`r resAnchor`}

### Enrichment plots {.tabset}

The results were then visualized with the `plotEnrichment()` function:

```{r childEnrich, results='asis'}
plts_verdsplit <- plotEnrichment(object, onlyCase = FALSE, onlyPOS = FALSE, splitby = "verdict")
resRmd <- lapply(
  names(plts_verdsplit), 
  function(db) {
    knitr::knit_child(text = c(
    '#### `r db`',
    '',
    '```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=10}',
    'plts_verdsplit[[db]]',
    '```',
    ''
  ), 
  envir = environment(),  
  quiet = TRUE)
  }
)
cat(unlist(resRmd), sep = '\n')
```

### Summary table

<details>
<summary>Additional Details</summary>

Annotations were derived from a variety of sources and accessed using *RLHub* (unless custom annotations were supplied by the user). Detailed explanations of each database and type can be found [here](https://github.com/Bishop-Laboratory/RLBase-data#preliminary). The `valr` package was implemented to test the enrichment of these features within the supplied ranges for **`r object@metadata$sampleName`**.
