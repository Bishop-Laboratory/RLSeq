## `r i`. `r names(resAnchor)` {#`r resAnchor`}

RL-Regions are consensus R-loop sites derived from RLBase as described in the RLSuite manuscript. The ranges supplied for **`r object@metadata$sampleName`** were compared to the RL-Regions to determine the degree and signficiance of overlap.

```{r}
plotRLRegionOverlap(object,
                    fill = c("#9ad9ab", "#9aa0d9"),
                    main.cex = 2,
                    cat.pos = c(-80, 80),
                    cat.dist=.05,
                    margin = .05)
```
