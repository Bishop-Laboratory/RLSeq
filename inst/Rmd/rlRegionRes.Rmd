## `r i`. `r names(resAnchor)` {#`r resAnchor`}

RL-Regions are consensus R-loop sites derived from a meta-analysis of all high-confidence R-loop mapping samples in RLBase (see the RLSuite manuscript for a full description). The ranges supplied for **`r object@metadata$sampleName`** were compared to the RL-Regions to determine the degree and significance of overlap. For additional detail, please refer to the `RLSeq::rlRegionTest` documentation ([link](https://bishop-laboratory.github.io/RLSeq/reference/rlRegionTest.html){target="_blank"}).

```{r}
plotRLRegionOverlap(object,
                    fill = c("#9ad9ab", "#9aa0d9"),
                    main.cex = 2,
                    cat.pos = c(-60, 60),
                    cat.dist=.01,
                    margin = .15)
```
