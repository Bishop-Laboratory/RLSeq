## `r i`. `r names(resAnchor)` {#`r resAnchor`}

Using the method described in [*Chedin et al. 2020*](https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2020106394), the inter-sample correlations between **`r object@metadata$sampleName`** and the samples in *RLBase* were calculated. 

In the resulting heatmap, **`r object@metadata$sampleName`** is identified via the `group` annotation.

```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=10}
corrHeatmap(object)
```
