## Correlation analysis

Using the method described in *Chedin et al. 2020*, the correlation between **`r object@metadata$sampleName`** and the samples in *RLBase* was calculated. In the resulting heatmap, we can observe the **`r object@metadata$sampleName`** which is identified in the `group` annotation as `user_selected`. 

```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=10}
corrHeatmap(object)
```
