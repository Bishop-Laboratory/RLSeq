Hi @lshep,

Thank you for the review of the packages! I have done my best to address your comments -- please let me know if I have misunderstood any of them.

# RLHub

## README

**Comment**

>Please include Bioconductor installation instructions of the package

**Response**

Thank you for the suggestion! I have now updated the `README` to include these.


## vignette

**Comment**

> * [ ]  Include Bioconductor package installation instructions.

**Response**

I have now updated this as well. 

**Comment**

> * [ ]  verifying  `{.r}` is the same as a `eval=FALSE` code chunk?

**Response**

Yep! That prevents code evaluation since it just makes a code block with R syntax highlighting. 

# RLSeq

## LICENSE

**Comment**
 
> * [ ]  Just wanted to verify as the authors are listed as `RSeqR` not `RLSeq`

**Response**

Yes! Thank you for pointing this out -- I have now changed it everywhere to reflect the correct name. 

## inst

**Comment**

**Response**

Thank you for pointing this out! I have now updated the `ext-data` folder to be called `extdata`. The `Rmd` folder is where the RMarkdown templates required for the `report` function are located. I have included a `README.md` in `inst/` now which explains this. 

The `int-data/` folder contained data used internally by functions in the package. I have now refactored the package such that all data is in the `data/` folder and the scripts used to build the data objects are in `data-raw/`. I have also added `data.R` in the `R/` folder, which provides documentation of each dataset.


## vignette

**Comment**

> * [ ]  Link of `RLBase` does not work.

**Response**
 
Thank you for pointing this out! It now works. 

### _Quick-start_

**Comment**

> * [ ]  `RLBase` link does not work

**Response**

I have now updated this as well.

**Comment**

> * [ ]  The vignette should not be referencing your s3 buckets directly. Use the
>   ExperimentHub interface to download the data for your vignette.

**Response**

These data are not provided in ExperimentHub at this time. They are processed files (there are over 1000 in total - ~ 60GB in total) which are generated by *RLPipes* (the upstream processing component of our software suite). The real-world data used in the vignette is unfortunately rather large (15MB for the peaks and ~150MB for the coverage). However, I feel that, without it, the user will not have a realistic example to observe -- which I think is important since a primary purpose of RLSeq is quality assessment. I also do not think it would be possible to store this data locally within the package due to size issues. In particular, I think that the bigWig (coverage) file does not need to be downloaded or cached since there are efficient methods via `rtracklayer` (which RLSeq uses) to pull the coverage within specific genomic intervals without the need for downloading the whole file.

## R code / man pages

**Comment**

> Again also where appropriate please update to access data through the ExperimentHub so caching of data is implemented.

**Response**

Please see my previous response above.


# Other changes

Here is a short summary of additional changes made in version `0.99.11`:

1. Documentation. I have written more detailed documentation of each function and data object in RLSeq.
2. Runnable code in RLSeq vignette. The only remaining non-evaluated R code is the installation instructions and the "Quick Start" as this takes quite some time to run as it is a realistic example.
3. Minor changes. I have added some minor changes to a few functions and updated some of the language / links in the report `.Rmd` files. 
4. Removal of tests. In order to allow all parts of the vignette to run, I had to remove the `tests/` so that it would all run within the allotted 10 minute window. I think that the tests were largely redundant, however, as they cover the same functions tested by the runnable examples during CRAN checks.
