Description: RSeqR is a toolkit for analyzing and evaluating R-loop mapping datasets.
    It serves two primary purposes: (1) to facilitate the evaluation of dataset quality, and
    (2) to enable to analysis of datasets in the context of genomic annotations and of
    publicly-available datasets. The package is intended to provide a simple pipeline, 
    called with the `RSeqR()` function, which performs all main analyses and outputs a 
    user-friendly HTML report. Individual functions are also accessible and provide custom
    analysis capabilities.
