Description: RLSeq is a toolkit for analyzing and evaluating R-loop mapping datasets.
    RLSeq serves two primary purposes: (1) to facilitate the evaluation of dataset quality, and
    (2) to enable R-loop analysis in the context of publicly-available data sets from RLBase.
    The package is intended to provide a simple pipeline, called with the `RLSeq()` function, 
    which performs all main analyses. Individual functions are also accessible and provide custom
    analysis capabilities. Finally an HTML report is generated with `report()`.
